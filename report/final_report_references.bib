	abstract = {Abstract. Unsupervised anomaly detection is the process of finding outliers in data sets without prior training. In this paper, a histogrambased outlier detection (HBOS) algorithm is presented, which scores records in linear time. It assumes independence of the features making it much faster than multivariate approaches at the cost of less precision. A comparative evaluation on three UCI data sets and 10 standard algorithms show, that it can detect global outliers as reliable as state-of-theart algorithms, but it performs poor on local outlier problems. HBOS is in our experiments up to 5 times faster than clustering based algorithms and up to 7 times faster than nearest-neighbor based methods. 1},

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the ‘why’, of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open theoretical and practical challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {Deep autoencoders, and other deep neural networks, have demonstrated their e ectiveness in discovering non-linear features across many problem domains. However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders’ ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, X = LD + S, where LD can be e ectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and S contains the outliers and noise in the original data X . Since such spli ing increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a “Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)”. Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such “Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)” give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {Telecommunication networks are designed for high reliability; however, when they do fail, it is difficult to detect and diagnose problems in a timely manner as the networks are characteristically complex and the problems may be subtle rather than catastrophic. Within the overall objective of network anomaly detection, the focus of this paper is on three aspects: Dimensionality reduction through feature selection to determine the minimum set of features that provide the most information regarding the network state; the application of the multivariate unsupervised learning technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to detect anomalies with low detection latency; and root cause analyses using finite state machines. For anomaly detection, we apply PCA on the normal data, and find the subspace where the variation of the normal data is small. By characterizing the variation of the normal data in the subspace, we derive a boundary of the normal data, and develop an anomaly detection model based on it. Once the anomalies are detected, we compare the message patterns of the anomaly data to those of the normal data to determine where the problems are occurring. Moreover, we examine the error codes in the anomaly data to better understand the underlying problems. The algorithms are developed and tested with Per Call Measurement Data (PCMD) records from a 4G-LTE network. The impact of our work is the proactive detection and root cause analysis of network anomalies in mobile networks, thereby improving network reliability and availability.},

	abstract = {Traffic anomaly detection has received a lot of attention over recent years, but understanding the nature of these anomalies and identifying the flows involved is still a manual task, in most cases. We introduce Unsupervised Root Cause Analysis (URCA) which isolates anomalous traffic and classifies alarms with minimal manual assistance and high accuracy. URCA proceeds by successive reduction of the anomalous space, eliminating normal traffic based on feedback from the anomaly detection method. Classification is done by clustering a new anomaly with previously labeled events. We validate URCA using manually analyzed real anomalies as well as synthetic anomaly injection. Our validation shows that URCA can accurately diagnose a large range of anomaly types, including network scans, DDoS attacks, and major routing changes.},

We show how a declarative language, such as SQL, can be effective in declaratively enumerating hypotheses that probe the structure of an unknown probabilistic graphical causal model of the underlying system. Our thesis is that databases are in a unique position to enable users to rapidly explore the possible causal mechanisms in data collected from diverse sources.

	abstract = {The concept of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) combines big data and machine learning methods to replace a broad range of IT operations including availability and performance monitoring of services. Such platforms typically use separate models for each modality of monitoring data (e.g., textual properties and real-valued response time in logs and traces) to detect faults and upcoming anomalies in cloud services, which do not capture the existing correlation between the modalities. This paper extends the range of utilized data types for creation of a single model to improve the anomaly detection. We use a bimodal distributed tracing data from large cloud infrastructures in order to detect an anomaly in the execution of system components. We propose an anomaly detection method, which utilizes a single modality of the data with information about the trace structure. In the next step, we extend the single-modality neural architecture to a multimodal neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) to enable the learning from the sequential nature of both modalities in the tracing data. Furthermore, we demonstrate an approach to detect dependent and concurrent events using the ability of the model to reconstruct the execution path. The implemented prototype is experimentally evaluated with data from a large-scale production cloud. The results demonstrate that the novel approaches outperform other deep-learning methods based on traditional architectures.},
