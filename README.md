# ANM-project: DANM! team 
Microservices-operated web services are extremely difficult to monitor and troubleshoot manually, that is whyAIOps research are gaining importance recently. This work studies different methods to anomaly detectionand root cause analysis in a web service environment. With the help of various performance indicators, wecreated two models capable of efficiently detecting outliers: the first one uses time series forecasting througha LSTM neural network with a moving average anomaly detection. The second model is hard coded with aset of rules to discover anomalous patterns in the live data. This report demonstrates the main steps of ourwork on the 2020 ANM project with explicit insights on the utilized methods, clear visual figures and in-depthdiscussion of the major issues encountered during the process.
